Master in Statistics Project – 2017  
🏆 1st Prize (University Level)

## Overview

This research project analyzed socio-demographic factors influencing customer preference for Public vs Private banks.

The study was conducted on 1,014 respondents, with 962 observations used for model fitting.

The project was designed, surveyed, analyzed, and interpreted from scratch and received 1st Prize recognition.

## Research Objectives

- Identify socio-demographic factors influencing Public bank selection
- Identify socio-demographic factors influencing Private bank selection
- Determine key criteria customers consider when selecting a bank
- Analyze demographic differences in selection behavior
- Rank socio-demographic groups based on factor importance

## Methodology

### 1. Binary Logistic Regression

Two separate models were developed:

**Public Bank Model**
- Significant predictors: Occupation, Housing Condition

**Private Bank Model**
- Significant predictors: Income, Father’s Education

Techniques used:
- Likelihood Ratio Test
- Stepwise Selection
- Wald Statistics
- Odds Ratio Interpretation
- Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit
- ROC Curve Analysis (AUC ≈ 0.64)

---

### 2. Factor Analysis

33 selection criteria were reduced using:

- Principal Component Analysis
- Varimax Rotation
- Polychoric Correlation Matrix
- KMO = 0.927 (Excellent sampling adequacy)

Five latent dimensions identified:
1. Customer-Friendly Services
2. Characteristics of Bank
3. Convenient & Required Facilities
4. Additional Facilities
5. Recommendation from People

### 3. Hypothesis Testing

- T-tests (Gender differences)
- ANOVA (Age groups)
- Post-hoc comparisons
- Ranking analysis

---

## Tools Used

- SAS (Statistical Modeling)
- Survey Design & Data Coding
- Logistic Regression
- Factor Analysis
- ROC Analysis
- ANOVA & Hypothesis Testing

---

## Key Contribution

This project demonstrates:

- Strong inferential statistics foundation
